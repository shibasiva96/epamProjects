Sorting of Collections
Difference between one collection to another(ArrayList vs LinkedList).
Sorting of Sets/How Sets store unique elements.
Fastest collection to access/insert/remove?Like: Setup, configure, Dependencies, Plugins, parameters, transitive dependencies and integration with Jenkins etc.
